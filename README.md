# Purpose of my Portfolio Website

# Functionality & Features of my Portfolio Website

The navigation bar for my portfolio website appears on every page. It is a version of a hamburger menu in that it switches from laying out all the menu buttons for larger displays to enabling a toggle button (3 horizontal lines) in the top right corner of the navigation bar. This makes the navigation bar more responsive.
