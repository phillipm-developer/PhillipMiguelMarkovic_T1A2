                <p>Bonsai wire sculptures have been around for a very long time but their recent surge in popularity is largely due social media. Artists and craftsmen all over the world are making and sharing stunning examples of their work online.</p>

                <p>Due to the availability of quality examples online, this art form has greatly evolved and improved in recent years and has attracted a lot of new talent; new artists are continually bringing fresh new ideas to the table. In this article we asked two craftsmen, Ken To and Matthew Gollop, to share their experiences with us.</p>

                <p>Ken To: Like everything else, there was a huge learning curve for me. There weren't many tutorials or books available on making wire bonsai at the time. My first tree took about 17 hours to complete, it was a very basic tree that I made for my wife for Christmas. I shared my trees on Facebook in a bonsai group and it caught the eye of Kevin Iris and he commented on my post; then he shared his wire trees and I realized just how amazing these sculptures can be. Needless to say, it was a life changing moment for me.</p>

                <p>The sculptures I make now take anywhere from 4 to 30 hours to complete, depending on the size and complexity of each piece. The process begins with deciding what type of tree sculpture to make, then there's the wire selection process, what gauge, what color, copper vs aluminum, what length and etc and ultimately ends with placing the tree in a pot (and some final adjustments).</p>
