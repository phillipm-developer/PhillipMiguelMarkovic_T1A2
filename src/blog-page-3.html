                <p>In this article we explain the potential benefits of using grow lights for your indoor Bonsai, and we help you pick the right setup. But first, let’s investigate the importance of light for different types of plants.</p>

                <header>
                    <h3>Does my Bonsai need extra light?</h3>
                </header>

                <p>Trees from from temperate climates need to be kept outdoors to thrive, as they need a period of winter dormancy each year. Deciduous trees don’t need light when they have shed their leaves, but even evergreen tree species do not need much light during their winter dormancy. Normally they don't need any supplementary lighting.</p>
                
                <p>However, lack of light can become a life-threatening problem for tropical and subtropical plants. This can happen when they are kept indoors too far from a window, if there is only a place at a a north-facing window available, or if there is too short daylight and little sunlight in winter where you live.</p>
                
                <p>Some tropical tree species can cope with little light if they are positioned cool enough in winter to take a rest period. At the same time, however, it must not get so cold that the plants are damaged. So it is often very difficult to create optimal living conditions for indoor bonsai of different species indoors without special aids. If the tree lacks sufficient light, perhaps in combination with dry, warm heating air, it will lose an unusually large number of leaves and become susceptible to pests such as spider mites, scale insects, etc. The tree will grow large, pale leaves and spindly shoots with long internodes, which significantly impair the appearance of the bonsai.</p>

                <header>
                    <h3>Using grow lights for Bonsai</h3>
                </header>

                <p>A good measure to help indoor bonsai trees in unfavorable locations or in warm places to become healthier and more vital over the winter is to use grow lights to supplement or replace natural daylight. However, there are a few things to bear in mind to ensure that the costs and benefits are in reasonable proportion.</p>

                <header>
                    <h3>Duration and time of day for artificial light</h3>
                </header>

                <p>Tropical and subtropical bonsai that are placed directly at a south- or west-facing window receive a few hours of natural light per day during sunny weather in winter. It may then be sufficient to switch on the grow lights for a few hours in the morning and after sunset, controlled by a timer, to give the bonsai trees a total of 12 - 15 hours of light (natural plus supplementary). If you observe your trees and their reaction to such a time-limited supplementation of daylight well, you will be able to determine for yourself whether it is sufficient. Depending on the room temperature and plant species, there may either be some healthy growth even in winter, or growth may pause but the plant will retain its leaves and their healthy dark green colour. Both scenarios are acceptable, but if the trees lose a lot of leaves, get unhealthy leaf colour or pests, the lighting may still not be sufficient. On a side note, very often something should perhaps be done to increase humidity as well.</p>

                <p>If the winter weather is overcast and gloomy, or if the bonsai are placed more than half a metre away from a large south or west facing window, it is advisable to switch on the grow lights continuously for 12 - 15 hours a day. A timer is also ideal for this task. It is not advisable to light the plants overnight, as they need their natural day and night rhythm. The dark season, when additional lighting is necessary or helpful, is roughly from the autumnal equinox to the spring equinox. So when the length of daylight falls below 12 hours, it is time to put the plant lamps back into action. So in the northern hemisphere this is roughly between September and March, in the southern hemisphere between March and September.</p>
